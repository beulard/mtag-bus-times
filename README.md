# mtag-bus-times

Tiny prototype for an ESP WROOM-32 board displaying bus times on an e-paper display.

The live bus times are queried from the [tag open data API](https://data.mobilites-m.fr/)
for a single stop in Grenoble, northbound and southbound. At most three departure times
are shown for either direction.

Developed using PlatformIO with the Arduino framework.
